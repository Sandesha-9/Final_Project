# Final_Project
The code files for this project are:
1.Commodity.java
2.CommodityDriverMaster.java
3.Driver.java
4.unspsc codes_3-1.csv
In this project,Arraylist, Linkedlist,stack,queues,Hashtable are implemented and some built-in methods that are present in Collection package are used. 
Firstly, Elements are being added using add method in for loop.
Secondly Elements are being sorted using Collections.sort(Parameter) method.
And lastly methods like contains, remove and max methods of Collection package are being used on arrayListCommodities, linkedListCommodities,stackCommodities, queueCommodities and tableCommodities and are printed using print method. This code is present in Driver.java file.
To use this code, after downloading these files you have to set path of unspsc codes_3-1.csv file in all of three files(Commodity.java, CommodityDriverMaster.java, Driver.java) using the actual path of folder in your computer after downloading. This will help to access csv file that contains data on which we are working. If you will not set the path of this csv file then you will get "file not found" exception. So make sure to set this path in files to correctly use this code.
